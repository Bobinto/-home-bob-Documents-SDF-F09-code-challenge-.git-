## Description
The project comprises three JavaScript programs aimed at solving different tasks:
Student Grade Program: This program prompts the user to input a student's mark and calculates the corresponding grade based on predefined grade boundaries.
Speeding Ticket Program: The program takes the speed of a car as input and determines whether the driver should receive demerit points based on how much the speed exceeds the speed limit. It also checks if the driver's license should be suspended based on the total demerit points.

Salary Calculation Program: This program calculates the net salary of an individual based on their basic salary and benefits, considering tax deductions, NHIF deductions, and NSSF deductions.

Key features of the project include:

Input validation to ensure user-provided data is within acceptable ranges.
Condition-based decision-making to determine grades, demerit points, and net salary.
Modularity through the use of functions for calculation, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
Clear output messages to inform users of the results of each calculation or decision.
Overall, the project demonstrates basic JavaScript programming concepts such as conditional statements, functions, and input/output handling while addressing real-world scenarios such as grading, speeding violations, and salary calculation.

## Project Setup.
Prerequisites
Web Browser: These JavaScript programs can be run in any modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.
Text Editor: You'll need a text editor to write and edit the JavaScript code. Popular options include Visual Studio Code.
Download Files: Download the JavaScript files containing the programs (e.g., student_grade.js, speeding_ticket.js, salary_calculation.js) from the provided source.

Open in Text Editor: Open the downloaded files in your preferred text editor.

Usage
Student Grade Program:

Run student_grade.js in your web browser or a JavaScript environment.
Input the student's mark when prompted.
The program will output the corresponding grade.
Speeding Ticket Program:

Run speeding_ticket.js in your web browser or a JavaScript environment.
Input the speed of the car when prompted.
The program will output either "Ok", the number of demerit points, or "License suspended" based on the input speed.
Salary Calculation Program:

Run salary_calculation.js in your web browser or a JavaScript environment.
Input the basic salary and benefits when prompted.
The program will output the net salary after calculating tax, NHIF deductions, and NSSF deductions.
